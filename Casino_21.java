/*Casino 21
In a casino game, the target score is 21. You are given a final score n. If the score is more than 21, the result is two times how much the score is above 21. If the score is 21 or less, the result is how many points it is below 21. Return the result based on this rule.
Examples:
gameResult(25)
→ 8
gameResult(21)
→ 0
gameResult(18)
→ 3
